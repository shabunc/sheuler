It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

9 = 7 + 212
15 = 7 + 222
21 = 3 + 232
25 = 7 + 232
27 = 19 + 222
33 = 31 + 212

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?

answer = 5777
