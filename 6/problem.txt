The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025  385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.


answer: 25164150


An interesting fact related to this problem is that the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the cubes is always 0, for any n: 
(1+2+3+...+n)^2=(1^3)+(2^3)+(3^3)+...+(n^3)
