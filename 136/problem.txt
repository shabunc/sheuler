Problem 136
29 December 2006

The positive integers, x, y, and z, are consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression. Given that n is a positive integer, the equation, x2  y2  z2 = n, has exactly one solution when n = 20:

132  102  72 = 20

In fact there are twenty-five values of n below one hundred for which the equation has a unique solution.

How many values of n less than fifty million have exactly one solution?

THEORY
(a + d)^2 - a^2 - (a - d)^2 = n
4 a * d - a^2 = n
4d = n/a + a
d = (n/a + a) / 4
