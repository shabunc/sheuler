Problem 39
14 March 2003

If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p < 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

max 1   12
max 3   60
max 4   180
max 5   360
max 7   420
max 8   840
