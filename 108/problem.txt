Problem 108
04 November 2005

In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.
1/x + 1/y = 1/n

For n = 4 there are exactly three distinct solutions:
What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds one-thousand?

NOTE: This problem is an easier version of problem 110; it is strongly advised that you solve this one first.

пока обнаружил только что f(p1^a, p2^b) = a + b + 2 * a * b + 1
но не могу обобщить эту формулу
